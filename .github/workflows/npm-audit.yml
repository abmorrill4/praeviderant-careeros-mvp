            ## Security Audit Failed
            
            High-severity vulnerabilities were detected in the project dependencies.
            
            **Action Required:**
            1. Review the audit results in the [failed workflow run](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
            2. Run \`npm audit fix\` locally to attempt automatic fixes
            3. For vulnerabilities that can't be auto-fixed, consider:
               - Updating to newer versions of affected packages
               - Finding alternative packages
               - Applying manual patches if available
            
            **Workflow Details:**
            - **Run ID:** ${{ github.run_id }}
            - **Triggered:** Weekly security audit
            - **Date:** ${new Date().toISOString()}
