## During the Interview

### Getting Started

1. **Session Initialization**
   - Click "Start AI Interview" from your dashboard
   - Choose your interview type
   - Grant microphone permissions when prompted
   - Wait for the AI to introduce itself

2. **Audio Check**
   - The AI will ask you to introduce yourself briefly
   - Verify you can hear the AI clearly
   - Confirm your voice is being transcribed accurately
   - Report any issues immediately

### Best Practices for Responses

**Be Conversational**
```
❌ Don't: "Managed team of five developers, increased productivity 20%"
✅ Do: "I led a team of five developers at TechCorp. We were struggling with missed deadlines, so I implemented daily standups and code reviews. Within three months, we increased our sprint completion rate by about 20%."
```

**Provide Context**
```
❌ Don't: "Used Python and AWS"
✅ Do: "I primarily worked with Python for our backend services, and we deployed everything on AWS. I got pretty comfortable with EC2, S3, and Lambda functions during that project."
```

**Include Specific Examples**
```
❌ Don't: "Good at problem solving"
✅ Do: "When our main database went down during Black Friday, I quickly diagnosed the issue, switched to our backup system, and worked with the team to implement a permanent fix. We minimized downtime to just 20 minutes."
```

**Share Numbers and Outcomes**
```
❌ Don't: "Improved sales"
✅ Do: "I redesigned the checkout process, which reduced cart abandonment by 15% and increased our conversion rate from 2.1% to 2.8%. That translated to about $200K in additional quarterly revenue."
```

## Advanced Interview Techniques

### For Career Changers

**Bridging Experience**
- Emphasize transferable skills from previous industries
- Explain your motivation for the career change
- Highlight relevant projects or learning experiences
- Connect past achievements to future goals

**Example Response:**
"Even though I was in marketing for five years, I've always been drawn to the analytical side. I started learning Python in my spare time and actually built a tool to analyze our campaign data. It saved us about 10 hours per week and gave us insights we'd never had before. That's when I realized I wanted to transition to data science full-time."

### For Recent Graduates

**Emphasizing Potential**
- Focus on academic projects and their real-world applications
- Highlight internships and part-time work
- Discuss leadership roles in student organizations
- Emphasize learning agility and growth mindset

**Example Response:**
"For my senior capstone project, I worked with a local nonprofit to build a donor management system. We used React and Node.js, and I was responsible for the entire frontend. The system helped them increase donor retention by 30% in its first year. It was incredibly rewarding to see my code making a real difference."

### For Senior Professionals

**Strategic Perspective**
- Focus on business impact and strategic decisions
- Discuss team leadership and organizational influence
- Highlight industry knowledge and expertise
- Connect individual contributions to company success

**Example Response:**
"As VP of Engineering, I wasn't just managing teams anymore—I was shaping our entire technical strategy. When we decided to migrate to microservices, I led the architecture planning, managed a team of 15 engineers across the transition, and worked closely with product and business teams to minimize disruption. The migration took 18 months but resulted in 50% faster feature deployment and 99.9% uptime."
