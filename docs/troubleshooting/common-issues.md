## üé§ AI Interview Issues

### Voice Input Problems

#### Issue: Microphone Not Working
**Symptoms**: No audio detection, "microphone access denied" message, or silence during voice interview.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Browser Permissions**:
   - Click the lock/info icon in your browser's address bar
   - Ensure microphone is set to "Allow"
   - Refresh the page after changing permissions

2. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Use Chrome, Edge, or Safari for best results
   - Firefox may have compatibility issues with real-time voice processing
   - Ensure your browser is up to date

3. **System-Level Permissions**:
   - **macOS**: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
   - **Windows**: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
   - **Linux**: Check PulseAudio or ALSA settings

4. **Hardware Check**:
   - Test microphone in another application
   - Try a different microphone or headset
   - Check microphone volume levels in system settings

**Prevention**: Test audio before starting important interviews using the audio check feature.

#### Issue: AI Doesn't Understand What I'm Saying
**Symptoms**: Frequent "I didn't catch that" responses, incorrect transcription, or AI asking for repetition.

**Solutions**:
1. **Speaking Technique**:
   - Speak at moderate pace (slightly slower than normal conversation)
   - Maintain consistent distance from microphone (6-12 inches)
   - Minimize background noise and echo

2. **Environment Optimization**:
   - Use a quiet room without background music or TV
   - Consider using headphones with a built-in microphone
   - Avoid rooms with hard surfaces that create echo

3. **Content Approach**:
   - Use clear, complete sentences instead of fragments
   - Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
   - Provide context before diving into specific details

4. **Alternative Options**:
   - Switch to text mode temporarily for complex technical terms
   - Use the "repeat question" feature if confused
   - Take breaks to avoid fatigue affecting speech clarity

#### Issue: Interview Session Keeps Disconnecting
**Symptoms**: Unexpected session termination, "connection lost" errors, or inability to resume.

**Solutions**:
1. **Internet Connection**:
   - Check internet stability (avoid WiFi during important interviews)
   - Close bandwidth-heavy applications (streaming, downloads)
   - Consider using ethernet connection for stability

2. **Browser Issues**:
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Disable browser extensions that might interfere
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode

3. **Session Management**:
   - Use the "Save Progress" feature regularly
   - Keep browser tab active (don't switch to other tabs)
   - Avoid refreshing the page during active interviews

**Recovery**: If disconnected, return to the Interview section - your progress is automatically saved.

### Transcription and Processing Issues

#### Issue: Incorrect Information Extracted
**Symptoms**: Wrong company names, dates, or skills captured from interview responses.

**Solutions**:
1. **Real-time Correction**:
   - Watch the extraction panel during interviews
   - Use the "correct" button immediately when you see errors
   - Provide spelling for unusual company or technology names

2. **Post-Interview Review**:
   - Always review extracted information before finalizing
   - Use the edit function to correct any inaccuracies
   - Add missing information through manual entry

3. **Prevention Strategies**:
   - Spell out unusual names and technical terms
   - Provide full company names, not just abbreviations
   - Include years explicitly ("in twenty twenty-two" not "in '22")
