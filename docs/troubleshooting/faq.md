## üé§ AI Interview Questions

### How does the AI interview work?
The AI interview uses OpenAI's advanced voice and language models to conduct natural conversations about your career. It asks strategic questions, listens to your responses, and extracts structured information about your experiences, skills, and achievements. The AI adapts its questions based on your answers and can conduct follow-up interviews to gather more detail.

### Can I use text instead of voice?
Yes! You can switch between voice and text modes at any time during an interview. Many users start with voice for natural conversation and switch to text for complex technical terms or when in noisy environments.

### How long does an interview take?
Interview length varies based on your career complexity and goals:
- **Quick Update**: 5-10 minutes for specific information
- **Standard Interview**: 15-25 minutes for comprehensive coverage
- **Deep Dive**: 30-45 minutes for complete career analysis
- **Multi-session**: You can break interviews into multiple sessions

### What if the AI doesn't understand my accent?
The AI is trained on diverse speech patterns and accents, but if you experience issues:
- Speak slightly slower and more clearly
- Switch to text mode for complex terms
- Use the "repeat question" feature if confused
- Provide spelling for unusual company or technical names
- Contact support - we continuously improve voice recognition

### Can I correct mistakes during the interview?
Yes! Watch the real-time extraction panel during your interview and use the "correct" button when you see errors. You can also review and edit all extracted information after the interview is complete.
